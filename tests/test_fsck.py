"""grok-fsck repacks, fscks and repairs repositories, and runs objstore migration.

The objstore part is where the interesting failures are. Repositories that share
a root commit are treated as forks of each other and get migrated into a single
objstore repository, which they then use through git alternates. Anything that
opts out of that -- a private repository, one carrying the
grokmirror.do-not-objstore marker, one that was pulled back out by hand -- takes
a path that has historically been much less travelled.
